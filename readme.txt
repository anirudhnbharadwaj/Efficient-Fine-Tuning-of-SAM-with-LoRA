1. Update the params1.json in the config/ for reproduceability.
2. Extract the NuInsSeg and update the dataset path.
3. As the checkpoints of each fold are huge, it could not be uploaded while submitting. Will try to upload it on GitHub(https://github.com/anirudhnbharadwaj).
4. The run was logged on WandB and the history is provided. (https://wandb.ai/anirudhbharadwaj2001-university-of-central-florida/nuinsseg_sam_lora_trial?nw=nwuseranirudhbharadwaj2001)
